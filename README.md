This is a web application built with the intention of replicating the classic
game of tic-tac-toe. This game is for two players who would play on the same
computer against each other. This project served as an introduction to
concepts such as factory functions, the module pattern, immediately invoked
function expressions (IIFEs) and encapsulation.

Factory functions can be used in JavaScript to create multiple "objects" of the 
same type, similar to how we would in a class-based, object-oriented programming language. A factory function for Player "objects" is used in the project code. 
IIFEs can be similar to factory functions in that they create an "object," but 
are distinct in that they are used to create a single instance of the object. 
Also, as the name implies, IIFEs are immediately invoked so the objects are instantiated immediately. Factory Functions and IIFEs both facilitate the
module pattern and encapsulation in JS to create a sense of OOP programming,
even though JS is traditionally viewed as a scripting language.
